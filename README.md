# EndpointPoller

------

## A _slightly_ over-engineered interview project


- Grabs SSL certificate and IP information of endpoints
- polls given endpoints for response information on an *_interval_* for a *_duration_* using REST requests
- Calculates uptime and latency 
- formats the data 
- writes it all to a csv
